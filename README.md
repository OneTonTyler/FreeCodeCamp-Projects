# FreeCodeCamp-Projects
This repo will house all of my solutions for FreeCodeCamp

The code in some of these projects will be rough. As I attempt a project, I am continously learning --
new ways to accomplish the same task, more attributes, and the style guide. 
Hopefully as I progress, you can see significant improvements between projects. Some projects may not be
as nicely designed as others because I need to make time for my wife :) 

I would like to re-visit these projects when I have more time. Once I am done with this initial course on HTML and CSS,
I am going to read HTML and CSS quick start guide by David DuRocher and HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett. This will be
so that I can understand more of what I could have done better.
