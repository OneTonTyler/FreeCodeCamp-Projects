                In the beginning of my teenage years, I led a relatively clean life. My bedroom was mostly squared
                away. Not because I was organized and neat, but I did not have a lot of stuff. Moving forward, I went
                to college and realized how messy I could be. I wouldn't fold my clothing, put trash on the floor,
                and overall never really kept the room squared away. However, about two months into the semester, I
                caught my roommate going through my room -- I was mortified. Embarrassed. Soon after that day, I
                refused to let myself ever revert to that.

                Well I thought I knew clean. Wipe the dust off, vacuum, put laundry away, etc... However, the
                military opened by eyes to a whole new world of clean. This guide will walk you through:
            </p>

                <li>What clean really means</li>
                <li>Best practices</li>
