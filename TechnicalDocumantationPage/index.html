                In the beginning of my teenage years, I led a relatively clean life. My bedroom was mostly squared
                away. Not because I was organized and neat, but I did not have a lot of stuff. Moving forward, I went
                to college and realized how messy I could be. I wouldn't fold my clothing, put trash on the floor,
                and overall never really kept the room squared away. However, about two months into the semester, I
                caught my roommate going through my room -- I was mortified. Embarrassed. Soon after that day, I
                refused to let myself ever revert to that.

                Well I thought I knew clean. Wipe the dust off, vacuum, put laundry away, etc... However, the
                military opened by eyes to a whole new world of clean. This guide will walk you through:

                Use this guide with caution, and best of luck!

                <p>
                    Every beginning starts with reevaluating what has brought us to this point. For me, I started when I realized how shitty I lived. I never grew-up. I lied to everybody I met, giving off this aurora of superiority that I was neat, clean, tidy, organized... Thought less of those who couldn't get their shit together. But then I got caught in my own facade. This was my moment of defeat. So I swore I would never let this happen again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To understand how to clean a room, you need to accept your situation for what it really is. Don't lie to yourself. How did you let it get this way?

                    As with any project, the foundation is crucial to our success. Remove everything! Furniture, clothing, books, toys -- everything that can easily go. Of course there are exceptions to this. For one, a bed and bed frame. But if it takes less than 5 minutes or less, it should be removed. We want to start with the bedroom in its most natural state. Empty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next we move into the basics. Vacuum. Emptying the room takes time. It is a physically demanding process, so that I why we will start with something less intense. Let us vacuum because we need to start with instant gratification. Something we can see a significant change to. Then what furniture remains, let us wipe. I recommend vacuuming the dust off first or wipe with a dry cloth, then go over with a cleaning solution. Once this is done, we can start slowly rebuilding. i.e. make your bed and reintroduce books to your bookshelf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thirdly, we will move into cleaning our walls. I recommend using a basic solution of soap and water for this. Magic erasers are find, but the main objective is to get and dirt, dust, and grim off that have accumulated over the years.

                    This is the most important part of our objective. Breaks matter. Going headfirst into this task will only cause resentment if we try to accomplish all of our objectives in one sitting. You will not want to clean your room ever again. Take as many breaks as you need. I recommend doing this after your first physically intensive task such as cleaning the walls.

                    We are now in the final stretch. It is easy at this point to say 'fuck it.' You have invested soo much time and effort into this project, and are ready to be finished. But do not let this feeling get in the way. Remain calm because the finish is our most important job. At this point we will reintroduce everything. But take your time. Do not be afraid to reorganize your room. Find what works and change what did not. I do this everytime because there is always room for improvement. I have reorganized my kitchen four time until I got it to a state that worked best for my routine. Do not skimp on this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once everything is back in place, we will vacuum again. This is important because during the cleaning process, dust and dirt have reintroduced to our floor. Let us take care of this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally we are finished. There is nothing left to do, but to rejoice in our new room. We do not need to add fancy sprays to make the room smell good. A clean room will always smell like it should. A room masked by fragrance is a room that had not been properly cleaned. Shortcuts had been taken, and fragrance is used to hide that. So lay in your bed. Play some video games. You have deserved it at last.
